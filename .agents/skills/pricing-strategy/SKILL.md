# Pricing Strategy Frameworks

## The Three Pricing Axes
1.  **Packaging:** What's included? (Features, limits).
2.  **Metric:** What do you charge for? (Per user, per seat, usage).
3.  **Price Point:** How much? (Based on value, not cost).

## Value-Based Pricing
*   **Floor:** Cost to serve (COGS).
*   **Ceiling:** Customer's perceived value.
*   **Target:** Somewhere in between, anchored against the "Next Best Alternative".

## Tier Structure (Good-Better-Best)
1.  **Starter (Good):** Low barrier to entry. For small teams/individuals.
2.  **Pro (Better):** The "Anchor" tier. Targeting growth users. High value/price ratio.
3.  **Business (Best):** Premium features, support, and scale. For enterprises.

## Differentiation
*   **Feature Gating:** Lock advanced features behind higher tiers.
*   **Usage Limits:** Scale price with volume (storage, API calls, active users).
