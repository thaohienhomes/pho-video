# Paywall & Upgrade Logic

## Core Principles
1.  **Value Before Ask:** Trigger the paywall AFTER the user experiences value (Aha moment).
2.  **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Use visuals/previews of the locked feature.
3.  **Respect the "No":** Always provide a clear "Escape Hatch" (Close button/Not now).

## Anatomy of a Perfect Paywall
1.  **Headline:** Benefit-driven (e.g., "Unlock 4K Export" NOT "Upgrade to Pro").
2.  **Demonstration:** Before/After comparison or video preview.
3.  **Pricing:** Clear monthly vs annual options.
4.  **Social Proof:** "Join 10,000+ creators".
5.  **CTA:** Action-oriented (e.g., "Start Exporting").

## Trigger Points
*   **Feature Gating:** User clicks a locked feature -> Show Paywall.
*   **Usage Limits:** User hits quota -> Show Paywall.
*   **Contextual:** User finishes a workflow -> Suggest "Do it faster with Pro".
